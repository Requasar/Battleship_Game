Warning: RST port on the PLL is not properly connected on instance clock_pll:clock_pll_1|clock_pll_0002:clock_pll_inst|altera_pll:altera_pll_i|general[0].gpll. The reset port on the PLL should be connected. If the PLL loses lock for any reason, you might need to manually reset the PLL in order to re-establish lock to the reference clock.
